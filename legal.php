MakeWhale believes in high quality and excellence in output, and so we optimize each print run to make the individual models/products look great, but some variation in colour shade is inevitable and the user/client/customer may see a difference in colour when looking at multiple prints of the same model.<br><br>

The products/models are made of hard, brittle material and the parts are required to be handled carefully. The models/products should not be exposed to high temperatures as our products contain various materials/ components/ metals/colour etc. that may be modified or damaged when exposed and hence users/customers must exercise due diligence while handling and using the products.<br><br>

Due to chemical reactions and properties, components such as steel and bronze when used individually or together over a period of time may result in the change of the colour of your product. Though items containing the mentioned metals are heat resistant to 831 degrees Celsius / 1528 degrees Fahrenheit, high temperatures may significantly change the material properties which will lead to damage of the products.
